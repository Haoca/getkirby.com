Intro: Hook into Kirby events and execute your functions in the background

Text:

There are two ways to register hooks: (link: docs/reference/plugins/extensions/hooks text: In a plugin) or in your `config.php`:

```php "/site/config/config.php"
return [
  'hooks' => [
    'page.delete:before' => function ($page) {
      // do something before a page gets deleted
    }
  ]
];
```
