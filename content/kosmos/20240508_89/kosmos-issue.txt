In the Kirbyverse, the last few weeks have been dominated by work on the new plugin directory and the community map, and there are also new Kirby screencasts for you. But read on‚Ä¶

## Kirby plugins

Kirby plugins have a new home: [plugins.getkirby.com](https://plugins.getkirby.com). It's taking the existing directory of plugins to a whole new level. The highlights:

*   üì∞ Get updates for new and recently updated plugins via RSS
*   üîé Additional search filters

More features including a form to easily submit your plugins are on the roadmap, so stay tuned.

[Kirby Video Embed Block](https://github.com/vyder/kirby-video-embed-block): A custom block to embed local videos into your website.

[Dark Visitors](https://github.com/mauricerenck/dark-visitors) is a plugin for Kirby 3 and 4 that blocks unwanted AI Crawlers from your website using robots.txt. It uses the Dark Visitors API to identify and block unwanted visitors.

## Kirby meetups

It is now a good tradition that attendees of the Beyond Tellerrand conference in D√ºsseldorf, who are interested in Kirby, meet for an informal get-together. You are invited to join Bastian and Lukas before the evening talk on Monday, May 13th. We‚Äôll gather at the main bar. You don't need to register for the meetup, but you need to be an attendee of the conference in order to join.

## Kirby learning

Basti continued the flow and recorded new screencasts for you:

[Building menus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-v97mSMSo&feature=youtu.be): In this video, we are looking at ways to build navigation menus for your site. We start with a simple menu, to then move on to more complex, nested menus.

[How to import data into Kirby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWa_cmbuxLw): In this video, you will learn how to use the Kirby command line interface to create your own commands. We will fetch Kirby's Mastodon feed as JSON via the Mastodon API and create pages for each post.

## Kirby cosmos

[From Grav to Kirby](https://assbach.de/blog/tag:kirby): Sascha A√übach shares learnings and insights from his journey of migrating his site (in German).

[Inside Kirby CMS](https://craftentries.io/podcast/inside-kirby-cms): Thomas Sausen sat down with Bastian to discuss the creation of Kirby, the strategic decision to use a file-based system, and the extensive customization options that make Kirby a developer's dream.

## This & That

Understanding the syntax to get [responsive images](https://getkirby.com/docs/cookbook/performance/responsive-images) right can be daunting. Maybe that's the reason why we still see so many websites that don't use them. Alex MacArthur shares his hope that [one day we won't need them anymore](https://macarthur.me/posts/distaste-for-responsive-images/).

We all know that images that are not purely decorative should have descriptive alt text (and not the file name or descriptions that don't really say what's in the picture that we see so often). Here are two articles dedicated to this topic, giving valuable tips: [Long Alt](https://adrianroselli.com/2024/04/long-alt.html,) by Adrian Roselli and [Write Alt Text Like You‚Äôre Talking To A Friend](https://cloudfour.com/thinks/write-alt-text-like-youre-talking-to-a-friend/) by Scott Vandehey.

You can find many HTML to Markdown converters on the Internet. The [MarkdownDown](https://markdowndown.vercel.app/) web app is nice because it also downloads images for you and has some other options. This is nice for occasional conversion tasks. If you need to do stuff programmatically, you will probably prefer something that you can access via API, use on the command line or [via PHP.](https://github.com/thephpleague/html-to-markdown)

[Marta](https://marta.sh/) is a dual-pane file manager for macOS that allows you to do basic file operations like moving or copying files. Good thing is that it also allows you to easily create new files.

[Aligning content blocks vertically](https://web.dev/blog/align-content-block) without flex box is now available in all latest versions of major browsers.

Heydon Pickering show how to [test for most kinds of HTML patterns](https://heydonworks.com/article/testing-html-with-modern-css) (or antipatterns) just using the power of modern CSS selectors.

Create a configurable [toggle component with modern CSS](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-highly-configurable-switch-component-using-modern-css/).

[It's the end of the web as we know it](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/it-s-the-end-of-the-web-as-we-know-it/ar-AA1nt2as): "The advent of AI threatens to destroy the complex online ecosystem that allows writers, artists, and other creators to reach human audiences".

Ahmad Shadeed shows how to [indent any type of tree view](https://ishadeed.com/article/tree-view-css-indent/) using CSS.

Index images, videos and news with [specialized sitemaps:](https://www.stefanjudis.com/today-i-learned/image-video-news-sitemaps/) You can either create separate sitemaps for images, videos or news, or extend your existing sitemaps with those more specific tags.
